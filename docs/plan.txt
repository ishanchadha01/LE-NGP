    run Hasher
    pick between Neuralangelo and Splatter


Hasher: ROS Node
    sub to wandb for sdf
    run sdf
    pub to points

Nueralangelo: ROS Node
    sub to images
    while img_bugger isnt full, spin
    run Neuralangelo model training epoch
    pub to wandb for sdf, rgb

Splatter: ROS Node
    sub to wandb for sdf, points
    run neural_sdf + splatting
    pub to wandb for sdf, rgb


TODO:
- document every major function call in neuralangelo currently
- same for 4dgs
- get rid of configs and setup and function calls that relate to rgb, but document what input and output need to be
- do same thing for sdf
- get point cloud output from neural_sdf and convert to colmap
- get sampled input to neural_rgb
2 models:
- 4dgs, where backprop needs to occur all the way through
- ceres for intensity+intrinsics+extrinsics->depth, which is sampled before being passed into rgb
- write out both methods in related works
- unit tests for each function
